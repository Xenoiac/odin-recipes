    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3/4 cup water (adjust as needed)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1/2 pound ground beef or lamb</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 small tomato, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>

</ul>
<ol>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <li>In a bowl, mix flour, salt, and water to form a soft dough. Knead for 5 minutes until smooth, then cover and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>In a skillet, heat a little oil and cook the onion until translucent. Add ground meat, garlic, tomato, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper. Cook until the meat is browned and fully cooked.</li>
    <li>Stir in chopped green onions or parsley, then let the filling cool slightly. Once cooled, add the beaten eggs and mix well.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into small balls. Roll each ball into a thin square or circle on a floured surface.</li>
    <li>Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each dough square, fold over the edges, and press to seal, forming a square packet.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Fry each mutabbaq until golden brown and crispy on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side.</li>
    <li>Drain on paper towels and serve hot. Enjoy this crispy, flavorful treat!</li>
